# Description: A writeup reflecting on the assignment.

(1) Anything positive you enjoyed or learned from this assignment
    We enjoyed implementing the Find-S algorithm that we learned in class. It was interesting to see
    the statistical component, and how many training examples it took for the exact target concept to 
    be learned.
(2) Anything negative you didn't like about this assignment
    Nothing
(3) Any parts of this assignment you found easy
    None
(4) Any parts of this assignment you found challenging or couldn't get working correctly
    None
(5) How your team functioned: 
    The team functioned by communicating through GroupMe for coordinating meetings, discussing solutions,
    and asking the other group members questions. A Zoom meeting was held to split up work and review code.
    
    What each team member contributed:
    - Vihan: Tasks 1, 2, and 3. Documentation and testing.
    - Luke: Experimental Question (plots and statistics). Documentation and testing.
    - Suada: Writeup, documentation, and testing. Worked on task 3.

    How the team communicated with each other: 
    - GroupMe was used for immediate communication and working through any problems.
    - Zoom was used for a more in-depth discussion about splitting up the work, reviewing the code, and
    deciding how to proceed.

    How team software development & design was accomplished:
    - Team software development and design was accomplised by using GitHub and notifying other group members
    when they committed their code so that other members could review it.
